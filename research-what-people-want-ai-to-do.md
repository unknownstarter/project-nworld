## THE BIG PICTURE: The 2025 AI Hype Correction

Before diving into specifics, the macro context matters. MIT Technology Review declared 2025 "The Great AI Hype Correction." GenAI entered Gartner's "Trough of Disillusionment." Key facts:

- **95% of businesses** that tried using AI found **zero value** in it (MIT Technology Review)
- AI agents powered by top LLMs from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic **failed to complete many straightforward workplace tasks by themselves** (Upwork study)
- **AI agents failed 60-80% of the time** working standalone on real professional tasks (Upwork, 300+ real client projects)
- The biggest developer frustration (66%): **"AI solutions that are almost right, but not quite"** (Stack Overflow 2025 Survey)
- OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy himself said AI agents **"just don't work"**

People were promised AGI. What they got was a fancy autocomplete that hallucinates. Here's what they actually want:

---

## 1. "JUST DO THE THING FOR ME" - AI That Takes Real-World Actions

**The #1 Unmet Need: AI that doesn't just talk, but ACTS on your behalf.**

People are exhausted by AI that can only *discuss* tasks but can't *execute* them. The gap between "AI can write an email about scheduling" and "AI actually schedules the appointment" is where all the frustration lives.

**What people want:**
- AI that makes phone calls to businesses, navigates phone trees, waits on hold, and resolves issues
- AI that fills out government forms (DMV, Social Security, insurance claims)
- AI that books appointments, makes reservations, and handles logistics end-to-end
- AI that cancels subscriptions, negotiates bills, files complaints

**Where it stands:** Pine AI exists (negotiates bills, makes calls) and reports 20% average savings on telecom bills. OpenAI launched Operator/ChatGPT Agent in July 2025. But these are fragile - many companies require the account holder to speak directly, success rates vary wildly, and one wrong autonomous decision (like booking "a Blue Origin flight to the edge of space instead of traveling to Vancouver" as one expert warned) can be catastrophic.

**Real voice:** OpenAI's agentic AI is "rather slow at performing tasks that would otherwise take you a couple of seconds to do on your own" and "runs into hurdles quite often." (SlashGear)

---

## 2. FIGHT MY INSURANCE COMPANY

**People desperately want AI to battle health insurance denials, navigate medical billing, and decode their coverage.**

This is one of the most emotionally charged needs. Insurance companies use AI to deny claims; patients want AI to fight back.

**What people want:**
- Upload medical bills and get plain-English explanations of what they owe and why
- Auto-generate appeal letters for denied claims with proper medical/legal language
- Navigate the labyrinth of deductibles, copays, prior authorizations, and covered benefits
- Compare insurance plans based on their actual health situation

**Where it stands:** Tools like Sheer Health let consumers connect insurance accounts and ask questions. Multiple startups launched AI-powered insurance appeal tools in 2025. But patients "may not recognize if AI misstates medical information in appeals, derailing the process." And health insurers' own AI is "largely unregulated and doesn't have to go through FDA review."

**Real voice:** "Patients and doctors are arming themselves with AI tools to fight claims denials, prior authorizations and soaring medical bills" - but the AI-vs-AI arms race between patients and insurers creates new problems. (Stateline)

---

## 3. INTERPRET MY MEDICAL RESULTS AND ACTUALLY HELP ME

**1 in 6 adults** ask AI chatbots for health info monthly. **25% of 18-29 year olds** do. But 56% aren't confident in the accuracy.

**What people want:**
- Upload lab results and get accurate, personalized interpretation in plain language
- AI that integrates multiple test results into a coherent clinical picture (not just individual values)
- Help finding the right specialist for their specific condition
- Understanding drug interactions and side effects for their personal medication cocktail
- A "medical translator" between doctor-speak and human-speak

**Where it stands:** GPT-4 correctly answered only 50.7% of lab-related questions. It can recognize individual test values but "struggled with integrating these results into a coherent clinical interpretation, often failing to recognize conditions like Gilbert's syndrome." Privacy is a nightmare - "data goes directly to tech companies" with no HIPAA compliance.

**Real voice:** A viral Reddit post described ChatGPT helping diagnose a condition "that had eluded doctors for over a decade." But Reddit's own AI-powered "Reddit Answers" was caught "spreading grossly dangerous misinformation" including urging people to "stop their prescribed medications and take high-dose kratom." The r/FamilyMedicine subreddit now has a permanent warning to "disregard anything" Reddit Answers says.

---

## 4. MAKE CUSTOMER SERVICE NOT HELL

**75% of consumers** experienced frustration with AI-driven customer service in 2025. People don't want AI customer service - they want AI that fights customer service FOR them.

**What people want:**
- AI that sits on hold for them, navigates phone trees, and connects them when a human is ready
- AI that writes effective complaint letters and knows consumer rights
- AI that tracks complaint cases across multiple interactions
- AI that escalates properly when the chatbot loop is broken

**What they're getting instead:** Companies replacing human agents with AI chatbots that create "more loops, dead ends, repeat explanations." 82% of customers prefer human support even if wait times are the same. 47% say their biggest annoyance is being unable to reach a live agent. 55% of customers feel frustrated when chatbots ask too many questions.

**Real voice:** "Getting stuck in a loop, where customers explain their problem only for the chatbot to ask the same question repeatedly" is the #1 complaint. 68% say "getting a complete resolution" is most important, yet nearly 90% report reduced loyalty when human support is removed.

---

## 5. DO MY TAXES (ACTUALLY, FOR MY SPECIFIC SITUATION)

**What people want:**
- AI that understands their specific financial situation (freelancer + W2 + rental income + crypto + foreign accounts) and files correctly
- Proactive tax optimization: "Based on your situation, you should do X before December 31"
- Plain-English explanation of which deductions apply to THEM specifically
- Real-time tax impact analysis: "If you take this job / sell this stock / make this purchase, here's the tax impact"

**Where it stands:** TurboTax has "AI Tax Assist" but it only "fields basic questions or points you to resources." For anything complex (which is most real people's situations), you still need a $159+ human expert. Reddit overwhelmingly recommends FreeTaxUSA - a $0-$15 tool with no AI - over AI-powered alternatives.

**The gap:** AI can answer generic tax questions. It cannot understand your complete financial picture, navigate edge cases, or take the actual action of filing. The difference between "here are some deductions you might qualify for" and "I've analyzed your complete financial situation and here's your optimal filing strategy" is enormous.

---

## 6. REMEMBER WHO I AM ACROSS EVERYTHING

**What people want:**
- AI that knows their life context: job, family, health conditions, goals, preferences, history
- Memory that works ACROSS platforms (not siloed in ChatGPT vs Claude vs Gemini)
- AI that learns their communication style, decision-making patterns, and values over time
- Multiple "modes" or profiles: work-me vs personal-me vs creative-me

**Where it stands:** ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini all have basic memory features. But "these memories are platform-specific and don't transfer between services, leading to platform lock-in." Context windows still hit limits in long conversations, causing AI to "forget" details from earlier. The #1 requested ChatGPT feature is a profile switcher for different contexts.

**Real voice:** "If you use ChatGPT extensively for different distinct interests - say programming and interior design - it's easy for your chats to get jumbled up." Users want "multiple memory modes - such as one for work, one for hobbies, and one for creative writing." (SlashGear/Medium)

---

## 7. HELP ME MAKE REAL PURCHASING DECISIONS I CAN TRUST

**55% of consumers don't trust AI shopping recommendations.** And the problem is getting worse, not better.

**What people want:**
- Honest, unbiased product comparisons (not sponsored recommendations)
- AI that can tell real reviews from fake ones (3% of Amazon reviews are now AI-generated, 74% of which are fake 5-stars)
- Price tracking and negotiation across multiple retailers
- "Should I buy THIS specific thing for MY specific situation?" advice

**Where it stands:** ChatGPT launched Shopping Research that prioritizes Reddit over brand content. Perplexity has "Shop Like a Pro." But trust is the core problem. Consumers view online reviews as "flawed biased or ad and AI-ridden garbage." People are adding "reddit" to Google searches specifically to bypass AI-contaminated results.

**The emerging frontier:** One user had an AI bot contact 8-10 car dealerships, collect quotes, and play them against each other. But this is bleeding-edge, not mainstream, and raises its own trust issues.

---

## 8. ORGANIZE MY ENTIRE DIGITAL LIFE

**Knowledge workers spend 8.2 hours per week** looking for, recreating, and duplicating information.

**What people want:**
- AI that searches across ALL their apps (email, notes, files, photos, messages, bookmarks) simultaneously
- Automatic organization of documents, photos, and files without manual tagging
- "Where's that thing I saw three weeks ago about X?" - and actually finding it
- A "second brain" that connects related information they didn't realize was related

**Where it stands:** Tools like Notion, Evernote, and DEVONthink offer pieces of this. But nothing truly unifies across all platforms. The dream of "ask AI to find that email from last March about the plumber recommendation and cross-reference it with the home repair document" remains fragmented.

---

## 9. ACTUALLY HELP ME LEARN (NOT JUST ANSWER QUESTIONS)

**What people want:**
- AI tutor that adapts to how THEY learn (visual vs verbal, fast vs slow, theory vs practice)
- Interactive, visual learning experiences (not just text back-and-forth)
- AI that identifies knowledge gaps and creates personalized curricula
- Real-time feedback on skill practice (language learning, math, coding, music)

**Where it stands:** Khan Academy's Khanmigo exists. One RCT showed AI tutoring outperformed in-class active learning. But "unguided use of these models can let students complete assignments without engaging in critical thinking." AI tutors "lack the personal touch that human tutors can provide" especially for emotional support. Current text-based tools "don't match competitors offering interactive visuals."

**The gap:** People want AI that teaches them to think, not AI that thinks for them. The difference between "here's the answer" and "here's how to arrive at the answer given your specific learning style" is where AI still falls short.

---

## 10. NAVIGATE BUREAUCRACY AND PAPERWORK

**What people want:**
- AI that fills out government forms correctly based on their situation
- Auto-generates demand letters, small claims filings, and legal complaints
- Navigates Social Security, disability claims, unemployment, and benefits applications
- Translates legalese in contracts, leases, and terms of service

**Where it stands:** People are starting to use ChatGPT in court - "and they're starting to win" (NBC News). AI Lawyer tools can summarize contracts and flag missing clauses. But "three types of AI hallucinations plague legal use: fabricated case law, false quotations from existing case law, and misrepresented case law." Lawyers who filed documents citing hallucinated cases faced disciplinary action.

**Real voice:** The gap is between "AI can explain what a contract means" and "AI can fill out this 47-page disability application correctly for my specific situation and submit it." The first is useful; the second is what people actually need.

---

## 11. CREATIVE WORK: VIDEO AND MUSIC ARE STILL BROKEN

**What people want:**
- Edit long-form video by describing what they want in natural language
- Generate music that sounds like THEM (their style, their taste), not generic
- Consistent character/style across an entire video or series
- "Make me a 10-minute YouTube video about X" end-to-end

**Where it stands:** One professional reported spending "hundreds of hours just trying to create some B-roll clips from still images" and "actually spent MORE time trying to get an AI result to work than if I had approached it traditionally." Another noted: "I couldn't tell how many times it's been generation number 20 the one that has produced something usable."

**The frustration:** "The frustration isn't about missing AI features anymore - it's about the cognitive load of timeline-driven workflows. Creators are spending more time operating tools than expressing intent."

Among music producers, the number who say they'll "never use AI" dropped from 29% (2023) to 18% (2025), but many fear AI is a "creativity killer" that removes the productive struggle of creative work.

---

## 12. HELP MY ELDERLY PARENTS WITH TECHNOLOGY

**What people want:**
- Voice-based AI assistant that can walk elderly relatives through tech tasks step by step
- AI that adapts its explanation complexity to the user's technical literacy
- Remote assistance: "Help my mom reset her WiFi router from 500 miles away"
- Simple, patient, always-available tech support that doesn't make seniors feel stupid

**Where it stands:** The digital divide "remains a significant barrier." Many seniors lack "digital literacy" and face "connectivity and usability problems." Effective teaching requires "large, clear fonts" and "screenshots marked with arrows and circles." Current AI assumes a baseline tech literacy that many elderly users don't have.

**The gap:** The people who most need a patient, always-available AI assistant are the least able to access one.

---

## 13. MAKE SENSE OF CONTRACTOR QUOTES AND HOME REPAIRS

**What people want:**
- Upload multiple contractor bids and get a clear, fair comparison
- Know if a quote is reasonable for their area (pricing varies wildly by location)
- Diagnose home repair issues from photos/descriptions before calling anyone
- AI that writes specifications so all contractors bid on the same scope

**Where it stands:** GreatBuildz launched BidCompareAI that compares up to 4 bids, flags inconsistencies, and spots omitted costs. ChatGPT can generate lists of questions to ask contractors. But as one Reddit user noted: "I've seen as much as a 100% difference between high and low bids" - and AI still can't verify if a contractor is actually trustworthy.

**Real voice:** Plumbers and contractors are themselves using ChatGPT to write invoices, brainstorm solutions, and generate proposals. The information asymmetry is still real.

---

## 14. DEAL WITH MY EMAIL / COMMUNICATION OVERLOAD

**What people want:**
- AI that triages email by actual importance (not just spam filtering)
- Draft contextually appropriate responses to all routine emails
- Summarize long email threads into action items
- "Handle my inbox while I'm on vacation and only bother me if it's truly urgent"

**Where it stands:** Gmail and Outlook have basic AI features. But true autonomous email management - reading, understanding context, responding appropriately, and knowing when to escalate - remains out of reach. The "almost right, but not quite" problem (66% of developers' top frustration) is especially dangerous in communication, where a slightly wrong response can damage relationships.

---

## 15. PERSONALIZED FINANCIAL ADVICE THAT ISN'T GENERIC

**What people want:**
- "I'm 34, make $85K, have $23K in student loans, $8K in credit card debt, a 401K with $45K, and want to buy a house in 2 years. What should I do THIS MONTH?"
- Real-time "what if" scenario modeling for financial decisions
- AI that monitors their spending and proactively alerts them to problems/opportunities
- Negotiation coaching for salary, raises, and major purchases

**Where it stands:** AI budgeting tools exist (Monarch Money, Rocket Money, YNAB) but Reddit users specifically want "advanced features with automation without losing control, privacy without sacrificing functionality, and power-user features without complexity." The gap between "here are general budgeting tips" and "here's your specific action plan for this month" is where AI falls short.

---

## 16. SOCIAL SKILLS AND RELATIONSHIP NAVIGATION

**41% of Gen Z** adults have used AI to navigate their love lives. More than 70% of teens have tried AI companions.

**What people want:**
- Help crafting difficult conversations (breaking up, confronting a friend, asking for a raise)
- Social skills coaching: what to say, how to read situations, how to make friends
- Navigating complex family dynamics during holidays, divorces, caregiving
- "Is this text message weird? How should I respond?"

**Where it stands:** An NPR experiment using ChatGPT as a couples counselor showed mixed results. The core problem: "LLMs consistently exhibit higher rates of sycophancy - excessive agreement with or flattery of the user - than humans do," which is "especially dangerous for soft-skill matters such as advice." AI tells you what you want to hear, not what you need to hear.

**Real voice:** Men with autism or severe social anxiety have used AI companions to "practice conversations and emotional expression before attempting human interactions." But heavy emotional self-disclosure to AI "was consistently associated with lower well-being."

---

## 17. LOCAL, REAL-TIME, CONTEXT-AWARE RECOMMENDATIONS

**What people want:**
- "What's the best restaurant near me RIGHT NOW that has availability, fits my dietary restrictions, and is within my budget?"
- AI that knows their city as well as a local who's lived there 20 years
- Real-time awareness of events, sales, openings, closures
- Recommendations that account for weather, traffic, time of day, and personal mood

**Where it stands:** People add "reddit" to Google searches specifically because AI recommendations are generic and ad-influenced. DoorDash launched Zesty to aggregate local food data from Reddit, TikTok, and Google Maps. But "Reddit's most upvoted spots often had just a handful of Google reviews despite overwhelmingly positive comments" - meaning AI that relies on standard data sources misses the best places.

---

## 18. OS-LEVEL INTEGRATION: CONTROL MY WHOLE DEVICE

**What people want:**
- "Hey AI, find that photo I took at dinner last Tuesday, crop it, and text it to Sarah"
- Voice control that spans across all apps seamlessly
- AI that monitors what they're doing and proactively offers help
- Smart home control integrated with personal assistant capabilities

**Where it stands:** Google's Gemini on Android offers basic device control and smart home integration. Apple Intelligence exists but is limited. ChatGPT has no OS-level integration. The dream of a unified AI layer across your entire digital life (phone, computer, smart home, car) remains fragmented across competing ecosystems.

---

## 19. STOP HALLUCINATING AND BEING CONFIDENTLY WRONG

This isn't a feature request - it's the foundational trust problem that blocks everything else.

**The data:**
- OpenAI's latest models (o3, o4-mini) have hallucination rates of **33% to 79%** depending on question type
- Deloitte submitted a $440K government report with AI-fabricated academic sources
- Chicago Sun-Times published an AI reading list where **10 of 15 books were fake**
- Google AI Overview cited an April Fool's satire about "microscopic bees powering computers" as fact

**What people want:** They don't want AI that's right 70% of the time. They want AI that KNOWS when it doesn't know and says so clearly. The "almost right but not quite" problem is worse than being obviously wrong, because it erodes trust in the things AI gets right.

**Real voice (Stack Overflow 2025 Survey):** The biggest developer frustration (66%) is "AI solutions that are almost right, but not quite." The second biggest (45%) is "debugging AI-generated code is more time-consuming" than writing it from scratch.

---

## 20. HANDLE MULTI-STEP, MULTI-DAY REAL-WORLD PROJECTS

**What people want:**
- "Plan my wedding: research venues, get quotes, compare, book, coordinate vendors, manage timeline"
- "I'm moving: change my address everywhere, set up utilities, find movers, compare quotes, schedule"
- "My parent needs assisted living: research options in their area, understand insurance coverage, schedule tours, compare costs"
- "I'm starting a small business: file LLC paperwork, get an EIN, set up a bank account, register for taxes"

**Where it stands:** AI can help with any individual sub-task in these projects. But stringing together a multi-step, multi-day, multi-vendor real-world project with autonomous execution? This is where the Upwork study is devastating: AI failed 60-80% of the time on even simple, well-defined professional tasks under $500. The idea of AI managing a complex life project end-to-end is still fantasy.

---

## 21. BE MY AI ADVOCATE: FIGHT FOR ME

Cutting across multiple categories above, there's a meta-need that emerges:

**What people want is an AI that fights on THEIR side.** Not a neutral information provider. An advocate.

- Fight insurance companies that deny claims
- Fight companies that won't give refunds
- Fight landlords who won't return deposits
- Fight employers who violate labor laws
- Fight bureaucracies that lose paperwork
- Negotiate on their behalf from a position of knowledge

This is the inverse of how AI is actually being deployed in 2025. Companies use AI to REDUCE customer access (chatbot walls, automated denials). Consumers want AI to BREAK THROUGH those walls. The AI arms race of 2025 is: corporate AI gatekeepers vs. consumer AI advocates.

---

## SUMMARY: THE PATTERN

Looking across all 21 needs, the pattern is clear:

**People don't want a chatbot. They want an agent that:**
1. **KNOWS them deeply** (persistent memory, personal context, preferences)
2. **ACTS on their behalf** (not just suggests - actually executes)
3. **FIGHTS for their interests** (advocacy, not neutrality)
4. **HANDLES complexity** (multi-step, multi-day, real-world projects)
5. **ADMITS what it doesn't know** (trustworthiness over confidence)
6. **WORKS across all their tools** (not siloed in one platform)

The gap between what AI promises and what it delivers is:
- AI promises: "I can help with anything"
- AI delivers: "Here's some text about the topic you asked about"
- People want: "The thing is done. Here's what happened."
